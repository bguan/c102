Chapter 0 Pre-Requisite
This booklet is presenting concepts as a series of C coding projects that highlights a couple of core concepts per chapter
You must have done some intro programming course such as AP CS, programming in C can feel a bit clumsy and antiquated in the modern age of computing
You must have learn some command line skills in a unix like environment and have access to such an environment, such as Linux using Terminal, MacOS using Terminal, or Windows 10 or 11 using cmd with WSL, or a web based virtual machine such as the free GoCalc terminal
If not, I would recommend watching this 1 hour free class on Youtube (but please do it across multiple sessions if you are new to this dark art!)
You must have learn at least the most basic C programming so that you can:
Write, compile and run a complete C program to print “Hello World” in a command line shell environment
Know how to declare and loop through an array of strings and int to perform some task like finding average string length or numerical average
Know how to organize code into functions
Know what a struct is and how to use it
Know the basic of pointers and references
Know how to allocate memory dynamically to store new data, as well as freeing it once you are done
Know how to use standard library to read the content of a text file, loop through it line by line, perform some processing like printing it out line by line, and closing the file when done
If not, you should watch something like a 3 hours C crash course on Youtube
