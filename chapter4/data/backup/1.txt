Chapter 1 Warm-up - Reading Text in Some File

Your assignment is to write a complete C program “process.c” compiled to executable “process” to:

Read the first argument given when the program is launched from command line i.e. argv[1]
This article explains what argc and argv of the main(...) function in C are used for https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.1?topic=functions-main-function
Check to see if this argument is a valid and readable file, Open & read the file, loop through and print out the content of the file line by line, followed by how many bytes the line has
Unnecessary details: A line in unix text file is terminated by the carriage return and newline characters pair “\r\n”
Print the total number of lines and the average line length
Close the file at the end
If everything ran normally, exit and return 0 from main()
If an error occurred at anytime during execution, print an error message to stderr and exit by returning 1 from main()
